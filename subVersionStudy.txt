Subversion : free/open source version control system (VCS).

Subversion's Components
   svn : The command-line client program.
   svnversion : A program for reporting the state (in terms of revisions of the items present) of a working copy.
   svnlook : A tool for directly inspecting a Subversion repository.
   svnadmin : A tool for creating, tweaking, or repairing a Subversion repository.
   mod_dav_svn : A plug-in module for the Apache HTTP Server, used to make your repository available to others over a network.
   svnserve : A custom standalone server program, runnable as a daemon process or invokable by SSH; another way to make your repository.
   available to others over a network.
   svndumpfilter  : A program for filtering Subversion repository dump streams.
   svnsync : A program for incrementally mirroring one repository to another over a network.
   svnrdump : A program for performing repository history dumps and loads over a network.

Cautions for using Subversions:
   Unix based cmd interface.
   backward slashes Â¥ instead of forward slashes / for path separators.

Vocabulary:
   top-down learner : gets a large overview first before getting into real work.
   bottom-up learner : learn by doing. Start the work first and get the big picture later.

//SV = Subversion

SV's Fundamental Concepts
   Repository : a central store of the system's data( filesystem tree form).
   copy-modify-merge solution instead of lock-modify-unlock solution.
   out-of-date error : local file is older than the repository's file.
      Other workers might have merged their files into repository.
      In git language, we can put this as 'conflict'.
   When 'locking' is needed : binary files like img,psd,or sound.
   Most important tip for avoiding 'conflict' : communicate with team.
